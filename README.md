## Data Analysis with Tensorflow-Keras
In this project we will examine the `iris` dataset. We will explore and doing some minor manipulations on the dataset. Doing some analysis and the finally we will do predictions.  

Lately I was writing notebook descriptions in english and realized to I don't writing descriptions on my native language, so I wrote this notebook in turkish.  

## Requirements & Installation  
You can go `../Packages/..` file path and you can run `requirements.py` python file. This file will setup all requirements automatically. But if you don't want to do it that way you can see the all requirements below.
